## Translators

The files in this folder are simple JSON maps. Has to be valid JSON or the parsing will fail (if in doubt: [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)). `{{variable}}` inside a translation string will be replaced with corresponding value.

`en.json` is recommended for copy and reference as it will be most up to date with existing keys. Translations don't need to be complete, though (would fall back to English string in that case).
